# Hi all! ðŸ‘‹ 

Nice to meet you. 

## About Me

About me... I enjoy reading books and coding. How did I get into code? During my career as an IT Technician at a local mall in my city. Ever since my journey has been consistent. I picked up most of what I know today while working on projects and reading. Not perfect, I'm still learning and teaching myself new coding techniques.
