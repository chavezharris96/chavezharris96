# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Chavez Harris (codedbychavez). It's nice to meet you. 

## About me

About me... I enjoy reading books and watching superhero movies while not coding or exercising. How did I get into code? TLDR; During my career as an IT Technician at a local mall in my city. Ever since my journey has been slow but consistent and I picked up most of what I know today while working on projects and reading blog posts from other developers. Currently, I'm still learning and teaching myself new techniques along the way.
